# DS_Project-1_FoodHub
Description: 
 FoodHub is a food aggregator company that connects customers with multiple restaurants through a single smartphone application. The app streamlines the ordering process by allowing restaurants to receive direct online orders from customers.

### Data Context
Order Placement: Customers place orders through the app, selecting their favorite dishes from various restaurants.
Order Confirmation: Once an order is placed, the restaurant confirms it through the app.
Delivery Assignment: After confirmation, a delivery person is assigned to pick up the order.
Pickup Process: The delivery person navigates to the restaurant using an integrated map feature, waits for the food package, and confirms the pickup in the app.
Delivery: The delivery person travels to the customer's location to deliver the order, confirming the drop-off in the app.
Customer Feedback: Customers have the option to rate their orders within the app.
Revenue Model: FoodHub earns revenue by collecting a fixed margin from each delivery order processed through the app.

### Objective
The primary objective of this data analysis project is to evaluate the order data stored in FoodHubâ€™s online portal to gain insights into restaurant demand. By analyzing this data, the company aims to enhance customer experience and optimize its operations.

### Data Description

The data contains the different data related to a food order. The detailed data dictionary is given below.

| Column Name              | Description                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `order_id`               | Unique ID of the order                          |
| `customer_id`            | ID of the customer who ordered the food        |
| `restaurant_name`        | Name of the restaurant                          |
| `cuisine_type`           | Cuisine ordered by the customer                 |
| `cost`                   | Cost of the order                              |
| `day_of_the_week`        | Indicates weekday or weekend                    |
| `rating`                 | Rating given by the customer out of 5         |
| `food_preparation_time`  | Time taken by the restaurant to prepare food   |
| `delivery_time`          | Time taken by the delivery person to deliver food|

### Stakeholder Interests
 * What percentage of the orders cost more than 20 dollars?
* What is the mean order delivery time?
* The company has decided to give 20% discount vouchers to the top 3 most frequent customers. Find the IDs of these customers and the number of orders they placed.
* Perform a multivariate analysis to explore relationships between the important variables in the dataset. (It is a good idea to explore relations between numerical variables as well as relations between numerical and categorical variables.)
* The company wants to provide a promotional offer in the advertisement of the restaurants. The condition to get the offer is that the restaurants must have a rating count of more than 50 and the average rating should be greater than 4. Find the restaurants fulfilling the criteria to get the promotional offer.
* The company charges the restaurant 25% on the orders having a cost greater than 20 dollars and 15% on the orders having a cost greater than 5 dollars. Find the net revenue generated by the company across all orders.
* The company wants to analyze the total time required to deliver the food. What percentage of orders take more than 60 minutes to get delivered from the time the order is placed?
* The company wants to analyze the delivery time of the orders on weekdays and weekends. How does the mean delivery time vary during weekdays and weekends?

### Methodology

##### Data Understanding and Preprocessing

First, I analyzed the structure of the dataset, identifying key attributes such as data types, shape, and missing values.
I conducted a statistical summary to understand the range, central tendencies, and spread of numerical features, ensuring any missing data was appropriately addressed.
 `              
##### Univariate Analysis

To explore individual variables, I performed univariate analysis, examining the distribution of each feature.
This involved generating plots like histograms, bar charts, and box plots to observe patterns and make initial observations about customer behavior and restaurant demand.

##### Multivariate Analysis

I then examined relationships between multiple variables through bivariate and multivariate analysis, using techniques such as correlation matrices and scatter plots to discover significant relationships.
Box plots and correlation analysis were used to study how various features like order cost, delivery time, and customer rating interact.



### Results
* An overwhelming amount (38.8%) of orders are not placing ratings.
* However it is good to see that the next highest rating is 5 stars.
* Orders time preparation takes between 20 minutes to 35 minutes which is very reasonable.
* The heat map didn't give us too much insight since a lot of our data was nominal and not just numerical.
* The average of the orders placed is $16.49.
* The median of the orders placed is $14.14.
* Given the previous info we can confidently say that most people will be placing orders under $20 when ordering off of Food Hub
* Surprisingly, the data showed that the ratings weren't affected much by the time it took to receive the delivery, so it seems like if we want to up our ratings, we might need to offer something as an incentive.

### Business Recommendations
 * In reference to the promted question about the promotional offer, the following restaurants should get that promo:
    1. The Meatball Shop
    2. Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken
    3. Shake Shack
    4. Blue Ribbon Sushi
 * The top 5 cuisines listed below, this could also be another idea of a category to offer promotions to.
    American, Japanese, Italian, Chinese, Mexican
 * On the weekends Vietnamese food is the most popular so it might be a good idea to coordinate promotions on the weekend for this cuisine.
 * If they'd like a KPI suggestion, it would be to make it a goal to have all orders delivered under an hour. One suggestion would be to offer a discount to those who pick up their orders, that would drastically reduce an orders "delivery time".
 * Since we can can count how many ratings people leave based on username, we could also offer promotions or rewards to those who leave reviews about their experiences with Foodhub or certain restaurants listed on the website.

### Future Enhancments 
Two suggestions could be offered to increase granularity of our data: 
1) Further categorize the data collecting to select the day of the week instead of just weekend or weekday, if we get more specific with our data collection we may be able to glean more about our customers.
2) If we can track the dates and delivery zipcodes with the data for lets say a month, we could see if sales dip or increase during a holiday or eventful weekends so we could tailor promotions to that.
